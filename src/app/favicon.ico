This is a placeholder for a favicon.ico file.

In a real project, you would create an actual .ico file with appropriate dimensions (typically 16x16, 32x32, and 48x48 pixels) and replace this placeholder.

Since we can't create binary content in this tool, we've used this text placeholder instead. You should replace this with an actual favicon.ico file before deployment.
